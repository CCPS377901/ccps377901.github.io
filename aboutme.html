	The goals that I am working towards in my professional life is to win a high school state champion, become a d1 collage basketball player, and/or get a degree in filming.
	

	  The way I'm gonna work for the goals is to working and practicing everyday to get myself better, I'm taking a film class so that I can have a back up career I will work to get better grades in that class and not let myself go down. There is no going back ready to push myself to achieve these goals.
	

	  The values I consider most necessary for my success is learning to work better with a team. In basketball team work is the most important you need to have chemistry with your team in order to go far, same with the film industry you have to learn to work with others to be truly successful.
	

	  My short term goals I hope to achieve in the near is to become a varsity level player by the time my sophomore year comes by, I want to build my confidence more I feel if you don't have enough you will not make it as far as you want to because it will continue to hold you back.
	

	I am funny person I love to make jokes to brighten up moods, I am someone who will always be there if you are feeling down, my highest achievement so far is my Freshmen District win against Barron, to my friends I can be energetic but I'm mostly someone likes to stay at home and get some rest.
